`zettel` is a simple FOSS tool to jot down notes using Zettelkasten methodology. The core aim of `zettel` is to store notes _for life_. The notes are in simple `markdown` format which can be published as a static website.

## Features

- Generate static website using `zettel build`.
- No external dependency of any app or SASS vendor lock in for your notes. `zettel` operates on plain markdown files.
- Generate **Connections** between notes with a simple syntax.
- Visualise all the connections with a Graph UI.
- No `$EDITOR` dependency. The markdown notes work same everywhere!

## Documentation

This is as meta as it gets. [Visit](https://zettel.hackstream.dev) `zettel`'s official documentation hosted on a site created by `zettel` and not this _boring_ Github README!
